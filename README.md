# adarklib

Python library to fetch download links from dark-world.ru asynchronously.
Use it as CLI tool, provide API or integrate to different tools like Telegram bot.

## Status

Since dark-world.ru goes down, this repo will not be updated.

## Motivation

dark-world.ru just disabled viewing of download links for some clients. This tool will help me (or you) to view that info.
